    <h1>RSS, BJP and the Creation of Rampyari Gurjar: History or Hindutva Myth</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, the story of Rampyari Gurjar—a young woman warrior who allegedly led an army of 40,000 soldiers to repel the 14th-century Turkic conqueror Timur—has gained significant traction in Indian political discourse. Championed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and amplified through BJP-affiliated social media channels and popular YouTube platforms, Rampyari Gurjar has become a potent symbol of indigenous valor and resistance. Political leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar have publicly lauded her courage, elevating the legend to national prominence.<sup id="ref1">1</sup>,<sup id="ref2">2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this narrative first emerged only in recent decades, with little to no grounding in credible historical records. Rooted in caste-based folklore and propagated by community histories, the story was constructed around claims of a “Mahapanchayat”—a grand assembly of local tribes and communities in Saharanpur and surrounding regions—that supposedly united to resist Timur’s brutal invasion. This article explores the myth’s origins, its political amplification, and the gulf between legend and verifiable history.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Myth of Rampyari Gurjar</h2>
      <p>
        The Rampyari Gurjar legend tells of a heroic woman warrior who led a massive force of 40,000 fighters—both men and women—from the Gurjar community and allied tribes. According to this narrative, after Timur’s sack of Delhi in 1398, the people of Meerut, Saharanpur, Haridwar, and neighboring regions formed a “Mahapanchayat,” uniting Jats, Gurjars, Ahirs, Valmikis, Rajputs, Brahmins, and others under leaders like Jograj Singh Gurjar and Rampyari herself. The story claims that Rampyari commanded a women's wing of 40,000 warriors who launched guerrilla attacks on Timur’s army at night, while the panchayat’s male warriors attacked during the day, inflicting heavy casualties and forcing Timur’s retreat from these areas.<sup id="ref3">3</sup>,<sup id="ref4">4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        This detailed narrative, often framed as a tale of grassroots resistance and female empowerment, has been circulated widely in books like <em>Saffron Swords</em> by Manoshi Sinha Rawal and various community accounts aiming to glorify Gurjar heritage.<sup id="ref5">5</sup> Yet, no historical or archaeological evidence supports these claims. Not a single Timurid chronicle, including the authoritative <em>Zafarnama</em>, nor contemporary Indian records, mention such a “Mahapanchayat,” or Rampyari Gurjar’s leadership or existence.<sup id="ref6">6</sup>,<sup id="ref7">7</sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Political Endorsement and Amplification</h2>
      <p>
        Rampyari Gurjar’s legend gained political traction through prominent endorsements. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a January 2023 speech in Rajasthan, praised her as a beacon of courage and valor, highlighting the Gurjar community’s contributions to India’s cultural and martial legacy.<sup id="ref8">8</sup> Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, in April 2020, referenced Rampyari Gurjar’s purported victory over Timur as a symbol of pride during the Akhil Bhartiya Veer Gurjar Mahasabha.<sup id="ref9">9</sup> Alongside these speeches, BJP-aligned social media channels and popular YouTube creators have further propelled the myth, blending folklore with political messaging to mobilize the Gurjar vote bank and bolster community pride.<sup id="ref10">10</sup>,<sup id="ref11">11</sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Historians' Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        Academic experts have widely dismissed the narrative of Rampyari Gurjar as historically untenable. Harbans Mukhia, a former professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, has described the claim as "absurd," emphasizing the logistical improbability of organizing such a large and well-equipped force in the chaotic aftermath of the Tughlaq dynasty's decline. Heramb Chaturvedi, a retired professor from Allahabad University, points out that Rampyari Gurjar is entirely absent from authoritative sources such as the <em>History and Culture of the Indian People</em> series, which comprehensively document the Delhi Sultanate and Timur’s invasions. Scholars also note that the Timurid chronicles, including <em>Zafarnama</em> by Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, make no mention of any woman warrior or “Mahapanchayat” resistance in the regions around Meerut and Haridwar. These academic positions are supported by investigations from fact-checking and journalistic organizations such as Alt News and Scroll.in, which have highlighted the lack of credible evidence for Rampyari’s existence and have characterized the story as a political myth promoted for electoral advantage. The Wire has similarly critiqued the politicization of such historical figures, noting how myths are used to construct identity narratives that serve current political goals rather than historical accuracy. Overall, the scholarly consensus views Rampyari Gurjar’s story as a modern myth with no firm foundation in primary historical records or archaeology.<sup id="ref12">12</sup>,<sup id="ref13">13</sup>,<sup id="ref14">14</sup>,<sup id="ref15">15</sup>
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The Role of RSS and BJP in Mythmaking</h2>
      <p>
        The RSS and BJP have strategically leveraged myths like Rampyari Gurjar’s to build caste-based political coalitions, especially among the Gurjar community, which is a significant Other Backward Class (OBC) group in North India. By elevating heroic figures—whether historically verified or not—these organizations seek to foster community pride, galvanize identity, and consolidate electoral support. While this mythmaking can inspire localized pride, it also raises concerns about distorting India’s complex history and potentially deepening social divisions. The promotion of politically motivated myths risks compromising historical scholarship and undermining efforts to cultivate a factually informed and cohesive national identity.<sup id="ref16">16</sup>,<sup id="ref17">17</sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Although Rampyari Gurjar’s story enjoys popularity in political rhetoric and social media, it lacks credible historical evidence. Originating from caste-based folklore and fabricated narratives such as the supposed “Mahapanchayat” that united tribes against Timur’s invasion, the tale has been amplified for contemporary political and electoral purposes. Promoting such myths threatens the integrity of historical scholarship and may exacerbate communal tensions. It is imperative to prioritize evidence-based history and encourage nuanced, factual understanding of India’s past—one that respects diverse cultural memories without succumbing to politicized distortions.
